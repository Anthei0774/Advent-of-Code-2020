# Advent-of-Code-2020
### Also my first repo.

Welcome to first my repository on Github. I am Anthei0774 and eager to show you my solutions for the international coding challenge, [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). I started this challenge in 2020 autumn when one my lecturers at the university recommended the group to participate. Since then, I had a great time, felt myself challenged while I was creating various algorithms to solve the daily problems. Without further ado, let us look into solutions.

### --- Day 1: Report Repair ---

**Part 1-2:**
It is an easy to read and solve problem just to warm up. With two nested loops on the indices *i, j* of the input, I found the two indices whose entries adds up to *2020*. With always starting *j = i + 1*, I never check the same pair as well. Part 2 uses three nested loops with *i, j, k* indices, and always starting with *j = i + 1, k = j + 1*, no triplets will repeat.

### --- Day 2: Password Philosophy ---

**Part 1-2:**
Still an easy problem to solve. After some minor formatting on the input, the Part 1 is done by using the built-in .count() method for string variables, checking if the occurences lie in the validity range. In Part 2, I had to subract 1 from the validity range, so the indexing will be proper, starting from 0, and with logic XOR = OR - AND, the solution is obtained.

### --- Day 3: Toboggan Trajectory ---

**Part 1-2:**
After reading the problem, the solution is straigthforward. Some minor preprocessing on the forest representation makes the rest of the code more simple. One loop on the rows defined with index *i* increments an other *j* index with *3*, and whenever *j* reaches the right side, I set it to *0*, as the forest-patters repeats horizontally. Part 2 is the previous process executed over all trajectories given.

### --- Day 4: Passport Processing ---

**Part 1-2:**
Reading this problem reminded me of [Papers, please!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RHH7M4siPM&t=5m6s&ab_channel=GameMaker%27sToolkit). The solution is to get good structure for the passports and then checking each one against the rules. This was not an interesting problem, because no logic or thinking was needed to solve it.

### --- Day 5: Binary Boarding ---

**Part 1-2:**
A lesson that I took in heart during my bachelor years at the university is when a problem/theorem/etc. has a short description, then it's either way too easy or the exact opposite, way too hard. An example for the former would be this problem, and for the latter would be [Caratheodory's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carath%C3%A9odory%27s_extension_theorem): "every quasi-measure can be extended to a measure", with its proof expanding more than 5 pages.
